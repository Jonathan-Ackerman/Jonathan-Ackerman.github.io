My name is Jonathan Ackerman, and I am currently a first-year student at Rutgers Universityâ€“New Brunswick. I have been programming for the past several years, and I have experience with Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and Java. Ever since I first learned to code, I have worked on independent projects to pursue my passion for computer science.
