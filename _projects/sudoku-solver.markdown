Using JavaScript, I created a program that could solve sudoku puzzles. Then, using HTML Canvas graphics, I wrote a user interface the allows users to input their own puzzles and find solutions. This interface provides users with the option to see the algorithm's progress in real time as it solves the puzzle.
