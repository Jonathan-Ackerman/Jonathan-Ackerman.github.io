In JavaScript, I implemented the minimax algorithm to create a program that could play Connect Four. In addition, because Connect Four is too complex for the algorithm to search all the way to the end of a game, I  developed other strategies for evaluating positions that were used in conjunction with minimax. For example, to see which player has an advantage in a given position, I wrote a function to count how many ways each player had three pieces in a row.
